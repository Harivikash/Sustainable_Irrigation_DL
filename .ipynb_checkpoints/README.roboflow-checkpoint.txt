The dataset includes 5890 images.
Flowers are annotated in YOLOv8 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -34° to +34° vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
